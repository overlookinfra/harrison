# Harrison

![GitHub release (with filter)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/puppetlabs/harrison)

Simple artifact-based deployment for web applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'harrison'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install harrison

## Usage

First, create a Harrisonfile in the root of your project. Here's an example:

```ruby
# Project-wide Config
Harrison.config do |h|
  h.project = 'harrison'
  h.git_src = "git@github.com:puppetlabs/harrison.git"
end

Harrison.package do |h|
  # Where to build package.
  h.host = 'build-server.example.com'
  h.user = 'jesse'

  # Things we don't want to package.
  h.exclude = %w(.git ./config ./coverage ./examples ./log ./pkg ./tmp ./spec)

  # Where to save the artifact by default.
  h.destination = 'pkg' # Local folder
  # h.destination = 'jesse@artifact-host.example.com:/tmp/artifacts' # Remote folder

  # Define the build process here.
  h.run do |h|
    # Bundle Install
    h.remote_exec("cd #{h.commit} && bash -l -c \"bundle install --path=vendor --without=\\\"development packaging test doc\\\"\"")
  end
end

Harrison.deploy do |h|
  h.user = 'jesse'
  h.base_dir = '/opt'

  h.hosts = [ 'util-server-01.example.com', 'app-server-01.example.com', 'app-server-02.example.com' ]

  # How many deploys to keep around after a successful new deploy.
  h.keep = 5

  # Built in phases:
  #  - :upload    Uploads your artifact to the host.
  #  - :extract   Extracts your artifact into a release folder.
  #  - :link      Creates a new deploy symlink pointed to the new release.
  #  - :cleanup   Removes deploys older than the --keep option, if set.
  #
  # You can override these phases by adding a phase with the same name below.
  #
  # You will probably want to add one or more phases to actually do restart
  # your application in an appropriate way.
  #
  # The built in "rollback" action will run your configured phases except
  # that it will not run any phases named "upload", "extract", or "cleanup".
  # Also, h.rollback can be inspected to distinguish a "rollback" action from
  # a normal "deploy" action.

  h.add_phase :migrate do |phase|
    # Only run this phase on util boxes.
    phase.add_condition { |h| h.host =~ /util/ }

    phase.on_run do |h|
      # Make the "current" symlink point to the new deploy.
      h.update_current_symlink

      h.remote_exec(%Q(bash -l -c "bundle exec rake db:migrate"))
    end

    phase.on_fail do |h|
      # Make the "current" symlink point back to the previously active deploy.
      h.revert_current_symlink

      h.remote_exec(%Q(bash -l -c "bundle exec rake db:migrate"))
    end
  end

  h.add_phase :restart do |phase|
    # Only run this phase on non-util boxes.
    phase.add_condition { |h| h.host !~ /util/ }

    phase.on_run do |h|
      # Make the "current" symlink point to the new deploy.
      h.update_current_symlink

      h.remote_exec("touch #{h.current_symlink}/restart.txt")
    end

    phase.on_fail do |h|
      # Make the "current" symlink point back to the previously active deploy.
      h.revert_current_symlink

      h.remote_exec("touch #{h.current_symlink}/restart.txt")
    end
  end

  # Define what phases to run and in what order on each host. Each
  # phase will need to complete on every host before moving on to the
  # next phase. If a phase fails on a host, all completed phases/hosts
  # will have the "on_fail" block executed in reverse order.
  h.phases = [ :upload, :extract, :link, :migrate, :restart, :cleanup ]
end
```

Next, ensure that your SSH key is authorized to log in as the `user` you have
specified in the Harrisonfile for each task. (Or be ready to type the password
a lot. :weary:)

### Building a Release

Use the `harrison package` command:

```
$ harrison package
```

By default this will build and package `HEAD` of your current branch. You may
specify another commit to build using the `--commit` option:

```
$ harrison package --commit mybranch
```

The `--commit` option understands anything that `git rev-parse` understands.
*NOTE: The commit you reference must be pushed to a repository accessible by
your build server before you can build it.*

By default, harrison will automatically detect the correct remote repository to
attempt to package from by first checking to see if the branch being deployed
is tracking a specific remote and if not, looking for a remote named "origin"
to package from. If neither of these is available, it will fall back to the
git\_src configured in your Harrisonfile.

The packaged release artifact will, by default, be saved into a local 'pkg'
subfolder:

```
$ harrison package
Packaging 5a547d8 for "harrison" on build-server.example.com...
Sucessfully packaged 5a547d8 to pkg/20140711170226-5a547d8.tar.gz
```

You can set the destination on the command line with the `--destination`
option, or specify a new default in your Harrisonfile:

```
h.destination = '/tmp'
```

You can also specify a remote destination:

```
h.destination = 'jesse@artifact-host.example.com:/tmp/artifacts'
```

The username is optional and, if omitted, the build user will be used. *NOTE:
Your build server must have already accepted the SSH host key of the
destination server in order to transfer the artifact.*

There are some additional options available, run `harrison package --help` to
see everything available.


### Deploying a Release

Use the `harrison deploy` command passing the artifact to be deployed as an
argument:

```
$ harrison deploy pkg/20140711170226-5a547d8.tar.gz
```

You can also deploy from a remote artifact source:

```
$ harrison deploy jesse@artifact-host.example.com:/tmp/artifacts/20140711170226-5a547d8.tar.gz
```

*NOTE: Each target server must have already accepted the SSH host key of the
source server in order to transfer the artifact.*

By default, the artifact will be deployed to the list of hosts defined in your
Harrisonfile.

You can override the target hosts by passing a `--hosts` option:

```
$ harrison deploy pkg/20140711170226-5a547d8.tar.gz --hosts test-app-server-01.example.com test-app-server-02.example.com
```

You can also pass an `--env` option to deploy into multi-stage environments:

```
$ harrison deploy pkg/20140711170226-5a547d8.tar.gz --env prod
```

This value can then be tested to alter the default target hosts in your
Harrisonfile:

```ruby
if h.env =~ /prod/
  h.hosts = [ 'app-server-01.prod.example.com', 'app-server-02.prod.example.com' ]
else
  h.hosts = [ 'app-server-01.stage.example.com', 'app-server-02.stage.example.com' ]
end
```

The hosts option in your Harrisonfile can also be defined as a block of code
which will be evaluated in order to calculate a list of hosts to deploy to.
The code block should evaluate to an array of hostnames, for example:

```ruby
h.hosts = Proc.new do |h; client, response, instances|
  require 'aws-sdk'

  AWS.config(region: 'us-west-2')

  client = AWS.ec2.client

  response = client.describe_instances(filters: [
    { name: 'tag:Name', values: ["app-server-*.#{h.env}.example.com"] },
    { name: 'instance-state-name', values: ['running'] },
  ])

  instances = response.data[:reservation_set].flat_map do |r|
    r[:instances_set] && r[:instances_set].collect do |i|
      name_tag = i[:tag_set].find { |tag| tag[:key] == 'Name' }

      name_tag[:value]
    end
  end

  instances
end
```

You can use the `--keep` option (or set it in the deploy section of your
Harrisonfile) to specify the total number of deploys you want to retain on each
server after a successful deployment. The default is to keep all previous
deploys around indefinitely.

There are some additional options available, run `harrison deploy --help` to
see everything available.
